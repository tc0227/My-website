    <p>Rainbow Six Siege can be a hard game to get in to, with most people who own the game already knowing how to play the game well. It’s worth it if you are able to get in to it as Ubisoft continues to add new content to the game on a regular basis and is a game that people could still be playing in 4 years. There is a starter version of the game which is only on PC and costs $15 USD and grants immediate access to 6 operators. However you get the rest of the operators slower than in the normal game.

    <p>Rainbow Six is available on Ps4, Xbox, and PC, but it is not crossplatform, meaning you can’t play with someone on a different platform than you. In my opinion; PC is the hardest as it has the best players. Once you know how to play the game however; I recommend switching over to PC. It might take a while to learn how to play, depending on the person, it took me about a month to be decent at the game.
    Certain guns take longer to get used to due to different recoil, either high or low. For instance; Sledge has a great primary in the L85A2, it does an amazing 47 damage which makes it a 3 shot to the body, it shoots 670 rounds per minute; which is on the slower side compared to the rest of the guns, but the gun makes up for it in damage. It can hold 30 bullets in a mag, and it has low recoil. However, his secondary; the smg 11 has one of the highest recoils in the game. It does 35 damage and shoots an outstanding 1,270 rounds per minute, the mag has 16 bullets. Giving you almost no time to control the recoil. Anyway, if you are looking for a new game to play or getting into gaming I recommend Rainbow Six Siege.
