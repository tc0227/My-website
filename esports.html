    <p> Rainbow Six Siege has a very wide pro league scene, where there are pro league events almost all year round and there are pro league teams all around the globe. The current team with the most money won is G2 Esports, with a total of $1,056,000.00 won. The Rainbow Six Siege events are run by ESL, which stands for Electronic Sports League. One of the most known pro players is Beaulo, who plays for TSM, which stands for Team SoloMid. Being a pro league R6 player is hard but itâ€™s rewarding. Pro league players get paid an average of between $1,000-$5,000 a month, along with the money they make from Twitch and Youtube. Being a pro player also boosts the money you would get from Twitch and Youtube. However; becoming a pro player requires a lot of experience and skill. I have been playing the game for about 2 years and I am nowhere near the level of a pro player.</p>
