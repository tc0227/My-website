    <p>What is Rainbow Six Siege, Rainbow Six Siege or referred to by the games’ fan base R6 is a tactical fps(first person shooter) that was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Toronto and released on Pc, Ps4 and Xbox 1, December 1st, 2015. The reason it is labeled as a tactical fps is because it is a very strategic and realistic based game. There are 3 game modes
    Bomb, the objective on bomb is the defenders have planted a bomb and if you are an attacker someone on your team will pick up the defuser and plant it in one of the two rooms on the site the defenders decided to defend, or you can just kill all 5 of the other team members before the time runs out. If you are a defender your objective is to stop the attackers from defusing the bombs or if they do plant it destroy the defuser before it defuses the bomb, or you can kill all 5 of the other team members. Bomb is the only game mode in ranked and in order to play ranked you need to be level 30. Ranked rounds last 3:00 minutes instead of the 3:30 minutes in casual. Both planting and destroying the defuser takes 4 seconds, once the defuser is planted the defenders have 4 seconds to destroy it.
    Secure area, the objective in secure area as an attacker is to secure the room the defenders choose to defend, or kill all 5 other team members. The objective as a defender is to successfully prevent the attackers from securing the room you choose to defend, or kill all 5 other team members. It takes 10 consecutive seconds to secure a room but when it is contested meaning an attacker and a defender are in the room no progress will be made in securing the room, when there is no attacker in the room and there has already been progress made towards securing the progress will start emptying until there is no progress made.
    Hostage, when you’re a defender in hostage you are holding somebody hostage and you have to prevent the attackers from rescuing the hostage, or you can kill all 5 enemy team members. As an attacker your objective is to rescue the hostage and bring them to the extraction point, or kill all five enemy team members. If someone on either team kills the hostage that team automatically loses the round.</p>
