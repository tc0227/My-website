<p>Shown here is every base operator in the game, in order from left to right; Sledge, Thatcher, Ash, Thermite; Twitch, Montagne, Glaz; Fuze, Blitz, Iq, Smoke, Mute, Castle; Pulse, Doc, Rook, Kapkan; Tachanka, JÓ“ger, and Bandit. Each operator had a different special gadget or ability that benefits them or their team. For example; Glaz has a thermal scope that can see through smoke and makes it easier to see enemies. His ability is beneficial to the player using him. Another example would be Rook; Rook has armour that he puts down and everyone on the team can pick it up. With the armour on; bullets do less damage and when you get killed you will get downed unless you get headshotted. This is an example where the team benefits from the gadget.</p>

  <p>What you see here is all of the current DLC operators currently in the game( as of August 27th, 2019).
Just like the base operators these operators all have a special gadget or ability that is either beneficial to the team or the player. For example; Blackbeard has a protective shield on his face that takes about 3 bullets to break and he has two. In Rainbow Six Siege, headshots are always an instant kill, so his shield is helpful but only to the player using him. Another example; Finka has 3 nanomachines that she can activate that give the whole team a short period of time where they have an additional 20 health, lower recoil, and many other things that give them an extreme advantage. Her ability also revives anyone who is downed. This ability is an ability where the team benefits
